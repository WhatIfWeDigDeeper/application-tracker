# PR Review: Implement and Respond to Review Comments

Work through open PR review threads — implement valid suggestions, explain why invalid ones won't be addressed, and close the loop by resolving threads and committing with commenter credit.

## Arguments

Optional PR number (e.g. `42`). If omitted, detect from the current branch.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `help`, `--help`, `-h`, or `?`, print usage and exit.

## Tool choice rationale

Different operations require different `gh` commands:

| Task | Command | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| PR metadata | `gh pr view --json` | High-level; handles branch detection |
| List review comments | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` | REST; simpler than GraphQL for reads |
| Reply to a comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments/{id}/replies` | REST; direct reply-to-comment endpoint |
| Get thread node IDs | `gh api graphql` | Thread node IDs only exist in GraphQL |
| Resolve a thread | `gh api graphql` mutation | No REST equivalent for resolution |

## Process

### 1. Identify the PR

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,title,baseRefName,headRefName
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number, pass it: `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json ...`. Otherwise, detect from the current branch. If no PR is found, tell the user and exit.

Also get the repo's owner/name for API calls:
```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'
```

**Ensure the working tree is on the PR's head branch.** If the current branch doesn't match `headRefName`, check it out now — otherwise file reads and edits will operate on the wrong code:

```bash
gh pr checkout <number>
```

### 2. Fetch Inline Review Comments

Pull all review comments on the PR using the REST endpoint:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {id, body, path, line, original_line, start_line, original_start_line, side, start_side, position, original_position, diff_hunk, in_reply_to_id, author: .user.login}' \
  | jq -s '.'
```

When deciding on action items, focus on top-level comments (where `in_reply_to_id` is null); treat replies as context. Filter for these after fetching (for example, with `jq 'map(select(.in_reply_to_id == null))'`) and still read reply chains to understand the full discussion thread.

**Identify suggested changes**: A comment body containing a ```` ```suggestion ``` ```` code block is a GitHub suggested change — the reviewer has proposed an exact diff. Flag these separately; they're handled differently from regular comments (see Steps 5–7).

### 3. Fetch Thread Resolution State

The REST API doesn't expose whether a thread is resolved. Use a focused GraphQL query to get that, along with the node IDs you'll need for resolution later:

```bash
gh api graphql \
  -f owner=OWNER -f name=REPO -F number=PR_NUMBER \
  -f query='
query($owner: String!, $name: String!, $number: Int!, $after: String) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    pullRequest(number: $number) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $after) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          isOutdated
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes { databaseId }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

This gives you a mapping from REST `comment.id` (= `databaseId`) → GraphQL `thread.id` + `isResolved` + `isOutdated`. Discard threads that are already resolved.

If `pageInfo.hasNextPage` is true, repeat the query passing `-f after=END_CURSOR` until all threads are fetched.

If there are no unresolved threads, report "No open review threads." and exit.

### 4. Read Code Context

For each unresolved thread, read the current file at the referenced path. The `diff_hunk` field shows what the reviewer saw; reading the current file shows what's there now. Both matter for your decision.

### 5. Decide: Accept Suggestion / Implement / Decline

**For suggested changes (comments starting with `\`\`\`suggestion`):**
- Evaluate the proposed diff directly — it's explicit, so the decision is usually clear
- **Accept** if the change is correct and improves the code
- **Decline** if it's wrong, conflicts with other changes, or is out of scope
- **Conflict check**: if the same file/line range is also covered by a regular comment you plan to address manually, don't batch-accept the suggestion — handle it manually to avoid a conflict

**For regular comments:**

*Implement if:*
- The suggestion is technically correct and would improve the code
- The referenced code still exists in its original form (thread not outdated)
- The change is within the scope of this PR
- It doesn't conflict with project conventions or other changes being made

*Skip (no reply) if:*
- `isOutdated` is true — the code has already moved on; treat this as part of the *skipping — outdated* category in your plan/report and do not post a new reply or resolve the thread

*Decline if:*
- The suggestion is incorrect, would introduce a bug, or conflicts with project requirements
- It's a style preference that conflicts with established codebase conventions
- It's clearly out of scope (worth a follow-up issue, not this PR)
- The reviewer misunderstood the code's intent and the current approach is correct

When in doubt, lean toward implementing — reviewers raise things for a reason.

### 6. Present Plan and Confirm

Before touching anything, show the user a clear summary as a table:

```
## PR Review Plan

| # | File | Summary | Action | Note |
|---|------|---------|--------|------|
| 1 | path/file.ts:42 | One-line description of what the comment says | `fix` | |
| 2 | path/other.ts:10 | One-line description | `accept suggestion` | |
| 3 | path/lib.ts:99 | One-line description | `decline` | Reason for declining |
| 4 | path/old.ts:5 | One-line description | `skip` | outdated thread |

Proceed?
```

**Action values:**
- `fix` — implement the change manually
- `accept suggestion` — apply the reviewer's inline `suggestion` block verbatim
- `decline` — post a reply explaining why; the Note column becomes the reply
- `skip` — outdated thread; no action taken

Wait for the user's go-ahead. They know the codebase and may want to override your judgment.

### 7. Apply Accepted Suggestions

GitHub's suggestion feature embeds the proposed replacement in the comment body as a `suggestion` fenced code block. The content of that block is the exact replacement for the highlighted lines — apply it directly to the file.

Handle accepted suggestions together with regular manual changes in Step 8. There's no public API to auto-commit them; you apply them locally like any other edit.

### 8. Implement Valid Changes

Make each manual code change. Group changes in the same file into a single edit pass. Keep track of which thread corresponds to which change, and which GitHub login authored each suggestion.

### 9. Commit with Commenter Credit

Stage and commit all manual changes. Give credit using `Co-authored-by` trailers — GitHub recognizes the noreply email format:

```
Co-authored-by: username <username@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Example commit:
```
Address PR review feedback

- Fix null check before dereferencing user object (suggested by @alice)
- Rename `tmp` to `filteredResults` for clarity (suggested by @bob)
- Extract magic number 42 to named constant MAX_RETRIES (suggested by @alice)

Co-authored-by: alice <alice@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: bob <bob@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Deduplicate co-authors — one entry per person regardless of how many suggestions they made. Suggestions accepted in Step 7 are applied locally along with your other edits and are typically included in the same commit.

**Commit fallbacks:**
- If GPG signing fails, retry with `--no-gpg-sign`
- If heredoc fails with "can't create temp file", write the message to a temp file and use `git commit -F <file>`

Include accepted suggestions in this commit alongside other manual changes — they're all local edits at this point.

### 10. Reply to Declined Comments

For each declined comment, post a reply using the replies REST endpoint:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  --method POST \
  --field body="[Explanation of why not implementing]"
```

Be direct and specific: state the reason, and offer an alternative if appropriate (e.g., "I'll file a follow-up issue for this"). No need to be overly apologetic — just clear.

### 11. Resolve Addressed Threads

Resolve each thread that was addressed (accepted suggestions and manual implementations). Use the GraphQL node IDs captured in Step 3:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_NODE_ID"}) {
    thread { isResolved }
  }
}'
```

Do not resolve declined threads — leave them open so the reviewer can see your reply and respond.

### 12. Report

```
## Done

Applied N suggestions + implemented N comments → committed <hash>
Declined N comments → replied with explanations
Skipped N outdated threads

[List of each action taken]
```

If the branch hasn't been pushed (manual commit only), mention: "Run `git push` to push the commit."

## Notes

- **Keyring access required**: `gh` needs OS keyring/credential helper access. Lift any sandbox restrictions that block this (in Claude Code: `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`).
- **Review threads vs. PR comments**: This skill handles inline code review threads. General PR body comments (top-level review text) are out of scope.
- **Multiple reviewers raised the same issue**: Give all of them credit in the commit message.
- **Draft PRs**: Treat comments the same as on open PRs.
- **Suggestion conflicts**: If a suggestion overlaps with a line you're also editing for another comment, apply the suggestion diff as your starting point and layer the other change on top.
