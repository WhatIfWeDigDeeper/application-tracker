  Get a fresh-context review of specs, staged changes, branches, PRs, or file sets.
  Delegates to a fresh-context reviewer by default; routes to external LLM CLIs
  (Copilot, Codex, Gemini) when --model specifies one.
  Use when: user says "review my changes", "peer review", "check for consistency",
  "review this spec", "review staged", "review PR N", "check this for issues",
  "fresh review", "another set of eyes", "sanity check", "quick review before I push",
  "look this over", "anything wrong with this", or wants a lightweight review before
  opening a PR. Also use for "review these files", "check this diff", or when the user
  pastes a diff or spec and asks if anything looks off.

# Peer Review

Get a fresh-context review of in-progress work — specs, staged changes, a branch diff, a PR, or a set of files — without accumulated session assumptions. Returns severity-grouped findings the author can apply or skip.

## Arguments

The text following the skill invocation is available as `$ARGUMENTS` (in Claude Code: `/peer-review [target] [options]`).

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `help`, `--help`, `-h`, or `?`, print usage and exit:

```
Usage: /peer-review [target] [--model MODEL] [--focus TOPIC]

Targets (pick one):
  (none)            Staged changes (git diff --staged)
  --staged          Same as no target — explicit form
  --pr N            PR #N diff + description
  --branch NAME     Branch diff vs default branch
  path/to/file-or-dir  Specific files or directory

Options:
  --model MODEL     Reviewer model (default: claude-opus-4-6)
                    Claude models: any claude-* value uses the internal Claude reviewer
                    External CLIs: copilot[:submodel], codex[:submodel], gemini[:submodel]
                      copilot — npm install -g @github/copilot-cli (or VS Code extension)
                      codex   — npm install -g @openai/codex
                      gemini  — npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
  --focus TOPIC     Narrow emphasis (e.g. security, consistency, evals)
                    Does NOT suppress critical findings outside the focus area
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` left-to-right:
- Strip `--staged` → set target type to staged
- Strip `--pr N` → set target type to PR, store N
- Strip `--branch NAME` → set target type to branch, store NAME
- Strip `--model MODEL` → store model override
- Strip `--focus TOPIC` → store focus topic
- Remaining token (if any) → treat as a file/dir path target

**Conflict**: if more than one target selector is present after parsing (e.g. both `--pr N` and `--branch NAME`, or `--pr N` and a path, or `--staged` and a path, or two leftover path tokens), error: "specify one target at a time — targets are mutually exclusive."

## Review Modes

The skill auto-detects the review mode from the target:

| Mode | Trigger | Focus |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Diff** | `--staged`, `--branch`, `--pr`, no target | Bugs, security issues, missing tests, style violations, unintended behavioral changes |
| **Spec** | Path resolves to a directory containing both `plan.md` and `tasks.md` | All consistency checks + gaps between plan/tasks, underspecified items, incorrect shell commands, internal math errors, implied-but-missing tasks |
| **Consistency** | Any other file/dir path | Drift between related files — stale step references, mismatched terminology, missing parallel updates |

## Process

### 1. Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` per the Arguments section above. Set `model` to `claude-opus-4-6` if not overridden.

### 2. Collect Content

Execute the appropriate collection command:

**Staged** (`--staged` or no target):
```bash
git diff --staged
```
If output is empty, warn: "No staged changes found. Stage files with `git add` first." and exit.

**Branch** (`--branch NAME`):

Detect the default branch first (do not assume `main`):
```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
if [ -z "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ]; then
  DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep 'HEAD branch' | sed 's/.*: //')
fi
git diff ${DEFAULT_BRANCH}...NAME
```
If the branch is not found, error with: "Branch NAME not found. Available branches:" followed by `git branch -a`.

**PR** (`--pr N`):
```bash
gh pr view N --json number,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,url
gh pr diff N
```
If the PR is not found, error and exit. Prepend the PR title and body as context to the diff before passing to the reviewer prompt — the title and body give the reviewer intent and scope that isn't visible in the diff alone.

**Path** (file or directory):

Read all files at the path (in Claude Code: use the `Read` tool). If the resolved path is a directory containing both `plan.md` and `tasks.md`, set mode to **spec**. Otherwise set mode to **consistency**.

### 3. Select Prompt Template

Choose the template for the detected mode and apply the `--focus` filter if provided.

**Diff mode prompt:**
```
You are doing a diff review. Your job is to find real problems — bugs, security issues,
missing tests, style violations, unintended behavioral changes.

Severity guide:
- critical: would cause incorrect behavior, data loss, or a security vulnerability in production
- major: likely to confuse users, break edge cases, or make future changes harder without being immediately fatal
- minor: style, naming, or polish issues that don't affect correctness

[DIFF CONTENT]

Return a structured list of findings grouped by severity (critical/major/minor).
For each finding include:
- Title: one-line summary of the issue
- Severity: critical | major | minor
- File: relative path (use "diff" if not file-specific)
- Location: phrase anchor — quote a short phrase near the issue (do not use line numbers)
- Problem: what is wrong (be specific)
- Fix: what the change should be

If there are no findings, return exactly: NO FINDINGS

Do NOT implement any changes. Return findings only.
[FOCUS_LINE]
```

**Consistency mode prompt:**
```
You are doing a consistency review across a set of related files.
Look for: stale step references, mismatched terminology, missing parallel updates,
descriptions that contradict each other, and underspecified items.

Severity guide:
- critical: contradiction that would cause the reader to implement the wrong behavior
- major: stale reference or mismatch that would confuse a reader or require rework to fix
- minor: cosmetic inconsistency or minor terminology drift that doesn't affect meaning

[FILE CONTENTS]

Return a structured list of findings grouped by severity (critical/major/minor).
For each finding include:
- Title: one-line summary of the issue
- Severity: critical | major | minor
- File: relative path of the file with the issue
- Location: phrase anchor — quote a short phrase near the issue (do not use line numbers)
- Problem: what is inconsistent or missing
- Fix: what the change should be

If there are no findings, return exactly: NO FINDINGS

Do NOT implement any changes. Return findings only.
[FOCUS_LINE]
```

**Spec mode prompt:**
```
You are doing a spec review. The input is a plan.md + tasks.md pair.

Check for:
1. Consistency between plan.md and tasks.md — every behavior in the plan should have a task; every task should trace to the plan
2. Underspecified task items — tasks that are too vague to implement unambiguously
3. Incorrect or incomplete shell commands
4. Internal math or count errors
5. Tasks implied by the plan but missing from tasks.md
6. Contradictions within or between the two files

Severity guide:
- critical: contradiction or missing task that would cause the wrong thing to be built
- major: underspecified item or shell error that would require re-work to implement correctly
- minor: wording ambiguity, count discrepancy, or cosmetic inconsistency that doesn't block implementation

[FILE CONTENTS]

Return a structured list of findings grouped by severity (critical/major/minor).
For each finding include:
- Title: one-line summary of the issue
- Severity: critical | major | minor
- File: plan.md or tasks.md
- Location: phrase anchor — quote a short phrase near the issue (do not use line numbers)
- Problem: what is wrong or missing
- Fix: what the change should be

If there are no findings, return exactly: NO FINDINGS

Do NOT implement any changes. Return findings only.
[FOCUS_LINE]
```

**Focus line** (append when `--focus` is provided):
```
Focus especially on [TOPIC]. Still report any critical findings outside this focus area.
```

### 4. Spawn Reviewer

**If `model` starts with `claude-` (including the default `claude-opus-4-6`):**

Delegate to a fresh-context Claude reviewer — pass the completed prompt (template + collected content). The reviewer has no prior session context — this is intentional. In Claude Code, spawn a subagent with `mode: "auto"` to suppress approval prompts.

The reviewer's only job is to return findings. It must not modify any files.

**Otherwise (external CLI path — copilot, codex, gemini):**

Determine the CLI binary and optional sub-model from the `--model` value. If `--model` contains `:` (e.g. `copilot:gpt-4o-mini`), split on `:` — the left part is the binary name, the right part is the sub-model.

| `--model` prefix | Binary | Sub-model flag |
|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| `copilot` | `copilot` | `--model SUBMODEL` |
| `codex` | `codex` | `--model SUBMODEL` |
| `gemini` | `gemini` | `-m SUBMODEL` |

If the prefix does not match `copilot`, `codex`, or `gemini`, error and stop: "Unsupported --model value: [value]. Supported external CLIs: copilot, codex, gemini. For Claude models, use a `claude-*` prefix (e.g. `--model claude-opus-4-6`)."

**4a. Check binary availability:**

```bash
command -v <binary> >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "<binary> CLI not found. Install with: <install hint>"; exit 1; }
```

Install hints:
- `copilot`: `npm install -g @github/copilot-cli` or via the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension
- `codex`: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- `gemini`: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`

If the binary is not found, output the error message and stop. Do not proceed to Step 5.

**4b. Write prompt to temp file:**

```bash
PROMPT_FILE=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/private/tmp}/peer-review-prompt.XXXXXX")
trap 'rm -f "$PROMPT_FILE"' EXIT INT TERM
printf '%s' "$PROMPT" > "$PROMPT_FILE"
```

Writing to a temp file preserves the exact multi-line prompt content and keeps prompt construction separate from the CLI invocation. In the commands below, correct quoting of `"$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")"` is what prevents shell metacharacters in diff/PR content from being interpreted by the shell. The `trap` ensures the temp file is removed even if the CLI command fails or the process is interrupted.

**4c. Execute and capture output:**

For copilot:
```bash
if [ -n "$SUBMODEL" ]; then
  REVIEW_OUTPUT=$(copilot --allow-all-tools --deny-tool='write' -p "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" --model "$SUBMODEL" 2>&1)
else
  REVIEW_OUTPUT=$(copilot --allow-all-tools --deny-tool='write' -p "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" 2>&1)
fi
```

For codex (`--no-auto-edit` suppresses file writes; unverified — adjust if your version uses a different flag):
```bash
if [ -n "$SUBMODEL" ]; then
  REVIEW_OUTPUT=$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE" | codex --no-auto-edit --model "$SUBMODEL" 2>&1)
else
  REVIEW_OUTPUT=$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE" | codex --no-auto-edit 2>&1)
fi
```

For gemini (`--approval-mode plan` enables read-only mode):
```bash
if [ -n "$SUBMODEL" ]; then
  REVIEW_OUTPUT=$(gemini --approval-mode plan -m "$SUBMODEL" -p "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" 2>&1)
else
  REVIEW_OUTPUT=$(gemini --approval-mode plan -p "$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")" 2>&1)
fi
```

The `trap` set in Step 4b will remove `$PROMPT_FILE` on completion or interruption.

**4d. Parse output → normalized findings:**

For copilot: output is JSON with schema `{ summary, overall_risk, findings: [{ severity, file, title, details, suggested_fix }] }`. Extract `findings[]`; map `details` → problem, `suggested_fix` → fix. Apply severity normalization below. If `findings` is empty, treat as `NO FINDINGS`. If JSON is malformed, fall through to raw-output fallback.

For codex and gemini: output is markdown or plain text. First check if output is exactly `NO FINDINGS` — if so, treat as no issues. Otherwise parse severity from lines matching patterns like `[HIGH]`, `**Critical**`, `severity: high` (case-insensitive). Extract title, file, problem, and fix from surrounding lines. If no structured severity pattern is found, present the full output as a single `major` finding.

If parsing fails for any CLI: output raw text with the prefix "Could not parse structured findings; showing raw output."

**Severity normalization** (apply case-insensitively for all CLIs):

| Input severity | Normalized |
|---------------|-----------|
| `high` / `error` / `critical` | `critical` |
| `medium` / `warning` / `major` | `major` |
| `low` / `info` / `note` / `minor` | `minor` |

**4e.** Continue to Step 5 with the normalized findings.

### 5. Present Findings

If the reviewer returns `NO FINDINGS`, output:

```
## Peer Review — [target] ([model])

No issues found.
```

Then stop. Do not show an apply prompt.

Otherwise, parse the findings into severity buckets and display:

```
## Peer Review — [target] ([model])

### Critical
1. **[Issue title]** — `[file]`
   [Problem description]
   Fix: [specific change]

### Major
...

### Minor
...

---
Apply all, select by number, or skip? [all/1,3,5/skip]
```

Output this as your **final message and stop generating**. Do not supply an answer, do not assume a default, do not proceed to the next step. Resume only after the user replies.

### 6. Apply

On user reply:

- `all` — apply every finding by editing the files directly (in Claude Code: use the `Edit` tool); report each change as you make it
- `1,3,5` (comma-separated numbers) — apply only the listed findings
- `skip` — output "Skipped N findings. No changes made." and stop

When applying a finding, use the phrase anchor from the finding's Location field to locate the text in the file — do not use line numbers. If the phrase anchor cannot be found in the file, skip that finding and note it: "Skipped finding N — location anchor not found in [file]."

**PR target**: applying findings edits local files only. Do not stage, commit, or push. After applying, the changes are uncommitted local edits the author can review before deciding to push. Before applying, check that the current branch matches the PR's `headRefName` — if not, warn: "You are on branch X, not the PR branch Y — applying will edit files on X."

**Diff mode**: after applying all findings, suggest running tests or linting if the changes touched code: "Consider running tests to verify the applied changes."

After all edits are complete, output: "Applied N finding(s)." on its own line. If the target was `--pr N`, also output the PR URL as the final line. On `skip`, the summary line is already output — no PR URL needed.

## Notes

- **Fresh-context guarantee**: the reviewer has no history from the current session. It sees only the content you pass it. This is the primary value of the skill — the reviewer cannot rationalize away issues the author has normalized.
- **`--focus` does not suppress critical findings**: narrowing focus changes emphasis, not the severity threshold. A `critical` finding outside the focus topic will still be reported.
- **Multi-LLM routing**: `--model copilot[:submodel]`, `--model codex`, and `--model gemini` route the review prompt to the respective external CLI rather than spawning a Claude subagent. This allows getting a non-Claude perspective (e.g. `--model copilot:gpt-4o-mini`). The binary must be installed and on `PATH`; if absent the skill errors with an install hint. Each CLI's output is normalized to the same severity-grouped findings format before Step 5.
