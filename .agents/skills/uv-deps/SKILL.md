# UV Deps

## Arguments

Specific package names (e.g. `fastapi asyncpg`), `.` for all packages, or glob patterns (e.g. `django-*`).

The text following the skill invocation is available as `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. in Claude Code, `/uv-deps fastapi asyncpg` sets `$ARGUMENTS` to `fastapi asyncpg`; other assistants pass arguments similarly). If invoked with no arguments, `$ARGUMENTS` is empty.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `help`, `--help`, `-h`, or `?`, skip the workflow and read [references/interactive-help.md](references/interactive-help.md).

## Workflow Selection

Based on user request:
- **Security audit** (audit, CVE, vulnerabilities, security): Read [references/audit-workflow.md](references/audit-workflow.md)
- **Dependency updates** (update, upgrade, latest, modernize): Read [references/update-workflow.md](references/update-workflow.md)
- **Ambiguous** (no clear intent, or invoked with no args): Read [references/interactive-help.md](references/interactive-help.md)

## Shared Process

### 1. Create Worktree

Create an isolated git worktree so the main working directory is never modified:
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
BRANCH_NAME="py-uv-deps-$TIMESTAMP"
WORKTREE_PATH="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/$BRANCH_NAME"
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

`git worktree add` writes to `$TMPDIR` and requires filesystem access outside the default sandbox. `gh`, `git push`, and `git commit` require OS keyring/credential helper access. Both may need sandbox restrictions lifted (in Claude Code: `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`).

If `git worktree add` fails due to a sandbox permission error:
> `git worktree` requires write access to `$TMPDIR`. Grant that access in your assistant's settings (in Claude Code: add `$TMPDIR` to the sandbox allowlist in `settings.json`) and retry.

**All subsequent steps operate within `$WORKTREE_PATH`.** Discovery, syncs, edits, and commits all happen there. Code blocks in reference files that show `cd "$WORKTREE_PATH/<directory>"` must run that `cd` explicitly — the working directory does not carry over between blocks.

### 2. Verify Tool Access

Verify that `uv` and `uvx` are available and can reach PyPI. See [references/uv-commands.md](references/uv-commands.md) for verification commands and troubleshooting.

All `uv`, `uvx`, `gh`, `git push`, and `git commit` commands require network and keyring access — lift any sandbox restrictions before running them (in Claude Code: `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`).

Do not proceed until verification passes.

### 3. Discover Python Projects

This skill targets `pyproject.toml`-based projects managed by uv. Projects using only `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, or other package managers (poetry, pipenv) are out of scope.

Find all directories containing `pyproject.toml` within `$WORKTREE_PATH` with a `[project.dependencies]`, `[project.optional-dependencies]`, or `[dependency-groups]` section, excluding `.venv`, `.tox`, `build`, and `dist` directories. Store results as an array of directories to process. If none found, report to user and skip to cleanup.

For **uv workspaces** (root `pyproject.toml` contains `[tool.uv.workspace]`): treat the workspace root as the single project directory and do not process member subdirectories individually — the root `uv.lock` covers all members. Run `uv sync` and `uv lock` from the workspace root only. To identify workspace members to exclude: after the initial glob, if the root `pyproject.toml` contains `[tool.uv.workspace]`, remove member directories from the discovered list, keeping only the workspace root in the `$DISCOVERED_DIRS` array. Note: `members` entries are glob patterns (e.g. `packages/*`), not literal paths — expand them to concrete paths before matching (e.g. `python3 -c "import glob, os; [print(p) for g in members for p in glob.glob(g, root_dir='$WORKTREE_PATH')]"` or run `uv workspace list --no-sync` from the root to enumerate members).

### 4. Sync Dependencies

Sync before identifying packages so that version checks are accurate. For each discovered project directory: Check `pyproject.toml` to determine which dev dependency pattern the project uses:
- If `[dependency-groups]` has a `dev` key (PEP 735): use `uv sync --group dev` ← preferred (newer standard)
- Else if `[project.optional-dependencies]` has a `dev` key: use `uv sync --extra dev`
- If neither exists: use `uv sync`

If both `[dependency-groups]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]` have a `dev` key (migration scenario), prefer `[dependency-groups]` as it is the PEP 735 standard.

If `uv sync` fails (e.g., resolver conflicts, missing packages, unsupported Python version), report the error, skip this project directory, and continue with the remaining directories.

See [references/uv-commands.md](references/uv-commands.md) for full command reference.

### 5. Identify Packages

- Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine packages
- For `.`, process all dependencies from `[project.dependencies]`, `[project.optional-dependencies]`, and `[dependency-groups]`
- For globs (e.g. `django-*`), expand against all dependency sections
- For specific names, validate they exist in `[project.dependencies]`, `[project.optional-dependencies]`, or `[dependency-groups]`
- Warn if a package name or glob matches nothing and list available packages

### 6. Validate Changes

Detect available validators by checking `pyproject.toml` for `mypy`, `ruff`, and `pytest` in any dependency section. Run whichever are present via `uv run` (see [references/uv-commands.md](references/uv-commands.md) for commands). Prefer project task runners if present — check for `Makefile`, `tox.ini`, or `noxfile.py` files in the project directory (not just `pyproject.toml`).

- **On overall validation failure**: continue running validation to collect all errors before reporting
- **On per-package failure after update**: revert that package before continuing with the next package (revert commands below)

If validation fails for a specific package update, revert before continuing with remaining packages (replace `<directory>` with the actual project path):
```bash
# Run from within $WORKTREE_PATH/<directory>
git checkout -- pyproject.toml
git checkout -- uv.lock 2>/dev/null || true  # uv.lock may not be committed
uv sync  # run from project directory
```

### 7. Commit Changes

After all updates are validated, check whether there are changes to commit, then commit:

```bash
# Run from $WORKTREE_PATH
# Check if there are any changes before committing
if git diff HEAD --quiet -- '*.toml' '*.lock' 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "No changes to commit — all updates were reverted or no updates applied."
  # skip to cleanup
else
  # Stage all modified pyproject.toml files (root and workspace members)
  # 'git diff HEAD --name-only' covers both root and subdirectory files
  git diff HEAD --name-only | grep 'pyproject\.toml$' | xargs git add 2>/dev/null || true

  # Stage uv.lock files only if already tracked in git (root and per-subdirectory)
  git diff HEAD --name-only | grep 'uv\.lock$' | while read -r lockfile; do
    git ls-files --error-unmatch "$lockfile" > /dev/null 2>&1 && git add "$lockfile" || true
  done

  # $COMMIT_MSG is set by the calling workflow before this step.
  git commit -m "$COMMIT_MSG"
  # If commit fails due to GPG keyring access, retry with --no-gpg-sign
fi
```

Commit message format:
- Security audit: `fix: patch vulnerable Python dependencies`
- Dependency update: `chore: update Python dependencies`

### 8. Cleanup

Remove the worktree. The main working directory was never modified, so no stash restore is needed.

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH" --force
# Only delete branch if no PR was created (requires keyring/network access)
# If gh fails (network issue, sandbox, etc.), PR_URL will be empty — preserve branch on ambiguity
PR_URL=$(gh pr list --head "$BRANCH_NAME" --json url --jq '.[0].url' 2>/dev/null)
GH_EXIT=$?
if [ $GH_EXIT -eq 0 ] && [ -z "$PR_URL" ]; then
  # gh succeeded and returned no PR — safe to delete
  git branch -d "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null || git branch -D "$BRANCH_NAME"
else
  echo "Branch '$BRANCH_NAME' preserved (PR exists or gh check was inconclusive)."
fi
```

`--force` handles cases where the skill failed mid-run with uncommitted changes in the worktree.

## Edge Cases

- **Resolver conflicts after major upgrades**: When upgrading causes dependency conflicts (e.g., package A requires `foo<2.0` but package B needs `foo>=2.0`), document the conflict, offer to skip or add a version constraint, and continue with remaining packages
- **Push failure**: If `git push -u origin "$BRANCH_NAME"` fails, report the branch name and latest commit hash so the user can push manually. Do not delete the worktree branch — preserve it for the user.
- **Non-semver versions**: If a package uses CalVer (`2024.1.0`), pre-releases (`3.0a1`), or post-releases (`1.0.post1`), version tuple comparisons will not work reliably. Skip version-scope filtering for these packages and include them as-is if they appear outdated.
